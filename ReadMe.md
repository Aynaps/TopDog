##Top Dog

A social network platform for your best friend.
Top dog is a platform for the feline buddies where you get to see photos and like them to put them into
contenders to be the Top Dog.


##Goal
Our goal for this project was really to just make something hilarious and maybe bring a few smiles along the way, who doesnt like pictures of cute dogs?



#Tools Used

For this project the Front end was developed using React.js and the Backend was developed in Express and Node.js
*Note: The backend project files are not hosted in this repo but rather in the TopDog-Backend Repo

The database we used to store user info, images, etc are stored in the google cloud.

This project is still in development phase but the link to the site will be posted down here if you would like to see it.
